  The back of the car is looking worryingly flat as the girls reverse the white car out of Ballinasloe. With 70% of our clothes clean, a rogue sock in a handbag can be ignored.
  
  Live update - a range of emotions have just been released upon the realization we may not be able to assemble the old tent again. This is mostly a blessing as the chances of it being waterlogged are higher than they’ve ever been and something smells like wet mattress.
  
  Back to the matter at hand – a story from a few days ago. The girls had their tolerance for fear and mystery seriously tested while passing through a small Northern Irish town. With Annadale FM cutting through the Irish top 40 inexplicably – the soundtrack began to dictate the emotion. It began as a slow transition – and ended in a horribly enchanting orchestral piece that we could not turn off. It was the song that never ends.
  
  Needless to say, we put our feet on the accelerators and shotgunned up the M6 toward a better warmer and less pungent place. Approximately ¼  up the M6 a loud noise stared hammering on the roof of the white car. Luckily our driver spotten a median strip on the side of the M6 and used this for refuge and refuse. The passenger had to get out to inspect, the driver was convinced someone from Annadale was on the roof. It was now clear that a 50/50 mix of hysteria, paranoia and delusion were at play. Sense kicked in for one of the team who remembered the tent. All was velcroed down and the accellerators were re-engaged toward the Cooley Mountains for a seaside afternoon nap.
  
  Unfortunately the girls awoke at 10:30 pm – to the sound of doggers and child swappers. If fear was ever a real thing, it was now. It was Doggers Hour and what had once been scenic would now be an appropriate setting for a horror film. Through the foggy windows of the white car the girls made a call with very little convincing, the clutch was engaged and the white car was leveled up to full throttle. Once again we were out on the road experiencing homelessness through the eyes of two privileged once semi private school girls. The only sensical move now was to find a safe face traversing the M6, and follow them into their affluent neighborhood. Residential-car-sleeping has been good to us. We would recommend RCS to the budget conscious thrill seeker. We would like to take this time to thank the police force operating in Dublin for their concern and well wishes – you are hot and understanding.
  The girls have just ridden the M6 North Bound, from Land’s End into the old Scottish Heartland. The road is straight and wide but the minute you diverge off the big highway you are faced with a logistical nightmare of narrow roads enough to drive you to drink.
  
  Cornwall is a land of sharp corners, clotted cream and pasties. With a short stint here, our itinerary was on point and seriously full (thanks to Bill). Basing ourselves ‘in the middle of it all’ we set out for a day of exploration. The first thought of the day was to share a pasty, in hope to sample a wide selection through out the county. By using Tinder as a tour guide we were able to identify the hot spots for pasty consumption and also some background on the pastie itself.
  
  Fact – the pastie was invented in 1816 to be used as the perfect miner’s meal. The myth says that the crust is for practical holding reasons only, which then quickly turn spiritual and rhetorical once the mince has been eaten (hold by crust, eat, turf to ghosts).
  
  Following Bill’s inspired advice, Marizone was the town to hit with full force. Here we became enamored with two young men. We would like to thank the Marizone History Museum for facilitating this meeting and absolute fascination. Let’s be honest – TBC needed a new lease of life, and thanks to Marizone our longevity has been locked-down.
  
  Marizone quickly became expensive in terms of tolerance for the road and traffic regulations. The corners of the roads in Marizone are not easy to navigate and it seemed the girls might have been stuck in a giant maze. We suspect Cornwall was named after this evident absence of workable corners. CornerWall is the full name and you may find it obvious but we will point it out - Cornwall is the abbreviation. It rolls of the tongue easier and makes it a bit more mysterious, also this shortening is for tourism purposes (Cornwall does not like to advertise its bad corners to tourists – especially ones who drive).
  
  Obviously this world can’t be forever – as much as we would like it to be around as long as possible we did discover it ends. Just to set the record straight we would like to apologize to those who were living in denial of this morbid fact. The End of the World is located at Land’s End, again another strategic name coined by the great Cornish masters. The terrain is vast and grassy (see below); the views are second to none. The end of existence is so blissful yet blatantly thrown in your face – it would be impossible not to think of your own mortality when the universes existence is so uncertain and ultimately futile. The grass at the end of the world has a slightly different relationship to gravity than the other grass found in more common areas of the world. The grass sits above the land, creating a mattress surface over the hills for sleeping, resting, eating or bouncing.
  
  Traffic jams, road rage and Whether’s Originals defined the next leg of this trip. The temperament of the driver was really oscillating – as were her blood sugar levels. We reached Wales and our first experience was aggressive drivers. A few roundabouts later we had settled into the Welsh mindset and gathered the necessities for a baguette but not to understand Crymru. Aunty Carol’s house was open and all set up for our arrival. She had kitted out the mini bar with espresso and biscuits and all the makings for the beverages expected in a normal continental breakfast. Best of all Carol had filled the fridge with the TBC food of the year – Port Salut. We can’t thank you enough for your consideration of our love for dairy products.
  
  Day turned to night in the big Diff, one night only – this was a serious predicament as the girls needed to be 100% ready to leave by the AM. Unfortunately they did not arrive home until the AM but Carol’s partner happily extended the check out time til ‘whenever you want’ – thanks Tony.
  
  At about 4:00 pm the next day the girls hit an all time high when they realized they were out of Wales. A few self-diagnoses were made and serotonin levels were off the roof. The car was well on its way toward the Lake District, where the girls would make a temporary home. The girls entered the national park with big expectations and little vision – it was pitch black and our hazard lights were permanently on in the constant hope for a guardian to eventuate. Some fear was felt in the dark forest until signs for the Peter Rabbit show were left right and center - this simple gesture of youthful familiarity and safeness grounded the team. The night was spent searching for shelter until the girls realized – you can only ever be responsible for yourself and this was never truer than it was in Windermere.
  
  “The Angry Valley” - a place we don’t want to relive in words but we will. 
  
  The ethos of this small metropolitan area is one for all and all for one. After a surprisingly good sleep, a home was made on top of a hill with a pot of gruel, overlooking the lake. It would be a lie to say that we did not spread oats through out Windermere. Regrettably, an hour of this mornings time was dedicated the world’s worst cell phone network – Lycamobile.
  
  We provided somewhat of a spectacle to the locals of Windermere – but little do they know they were a spectacle to us.  All interactions we witnessed and experienced with other humans can be described as moderately to severely unpleasant.  
  
  All bad feelings aside – salvation was found. Camberwell Cheese farm provided information, rest and cheese (to be reviewed once consumed tonight on the side of the Loch).  We leave you now with the promise of a post set in the Scottish Highlands.
  
  Peace and love – and always remember – if we can, you can too. 
  DISCLAIMER THIS IS NOT TBC CONTENT - TBC would not typically feature such an offensive letter, however we believe it is in the public’s best interest to hear this story from the mouth of the young son. It is currently TBCs stance to have the bounty removed from Darvide’s head.
  
  I can’t even tell you how angry I am to be writing this final resignation letter to the assholes in HR.
  
  If you recall my cover letter I stressed the importance of fluidity within my work hours and performance expectations. I don’t think I misrepresented myself, yet here I am forced to write this letter apologizing to the public of Arundel for my lackluster performance both within the community and within the closed spaces that TBC inhabit.
  
  So this is my public letter of apology – read it and weep.
  
  It goes without saying but I’ll say it anyway – I am not genuinely sorry for anything I have done here nor do I have any sympathy for the citizens of Arundel that I have “offended to their core” – a direct quote from the horses’ (Shirley’s) mouth. My lack of empathy is not a reflection of an absence of bad behavior or a bad character – more of a lack of acceptance and appreciation of my character by the HR team. I would like to let you all know this letter is a formality and that’s the extent of it. Once this is posted in the Weekly Arundel Communication Catalogue I will be removing it from my PC, hard drive, cell phone and email records. Darvide will keep a paper copy locked in a vault just in case this comes back to bite me in the ass.
  
  This not the first time I have been in a predicament like this and it will absolutely not be the last if I keep things at a rocking pace.
  
  The worst thing about all of this is that I have upset Darvide. Darvide’s involvement has caused his and my job to be at risk and his remuneration seriously servered. Luckily Darvide feels at home in most public spaces in Arundel and he is protected by the Poetry Workers Union. I haven’t been honest with you about this but there is now a warrant out for Darvide’s arrest and it’s my fault. We are both preparing for the worst and have put a small amount of money aside each week for Darvide’s bail. I have listed the purple Fiesta on Gumtree and can only hope the interest is as high as my interest was when I first saw it on the Marizone streets.
  
  I will take this time again now to let you know that I’ve dragged Darvide into the depths. He’s gone down with my ship but that does not mean he cannot bounce back as he has in the past. He is a resilient young man and is always 100% on board with my escapades.
  
  Speak of the Devil he’s just whipped something under the door.
  
  Can’t go outside
  Need some sunlight
  Ran out of food
  Where is the young son?
  Free Darvide
  
  I know I proclaimed this letter initially as a resignation but I’d now like to revoke it. I would like to stay employed ‘til at least the silly season. However this is dependent on the equity I make on my purple car. I would still like to be the main point of contact for TBC social events including the Christmas Party and I would like to remind everyone that my grappa is locked in inventory and I won’t let it go. Don’t touch it and if you want to get rid of me I’ll pick it up next week. I know Shirley is the only one with a key and has her eyes on a night in with my grappa, making a steam pudding with it and then having a hot bath. Shirley – let me remind you this is an $80 bottle of fine Italian grappa - use some cheap shit from Tesco’s to soak up your huge pudding and hedonistic behavior. Your indulgences are not my problem and should have nothing to do with anything you talk to me about ever again. Screw you and your key, Shirley, you’re an idiot if you don’t know I have a strong criminal past and Darvide knows how to pick locks so nothing is safe in the office. Young Son out.
  Welcome back – I hope everyone has settled down after last weeks big reveal.
  
  Today is a special day as the girls celebrate (in style) the birthdays of two of the most up and coming women in the world and also in their very personal lives.
  
  On this day, the numbers of 26 and 22 resonate and will leave a residual glow on the office walls and the physicality of the women they relate to.
  
  “A year away will be your birthday again” - Darvide
  
  First lets introduce our oldest sister and huge TBC fan, Margaret Anita Mannion. What a true inspiration it has been to walk through your stomping ground since birth and share a biological and spiritual union. Nothing beats a good day in the yay, and I hope you are whizzing up a passion fruit mojito and checking the temperature of your culinary feats regularly.
  
  Our other sister is a local skeptic and non-believer in TBC  (this post is an attempt to change this) – the old Sarah Jane van der Linden. SJ can usually be found at the local curry house or baking an atlanic pink fish. SJ is transcending what it is to be a 22-year-old functioning adult in the 21st century.  We’d like to say it’s been real and whatever this is, it will continue for many moons.
  
  These two young daughters embody the TBC philosophy effortlessly – this comes as no surprise as they are the literally blood of our blood. TBC relies too heavily on positive affirmation from these powerful women – it keeps us firmly on our toes and constantly assured our content is the best on the Internet.
  
  So happy birthday girls, we miss you, we love you and we want to be you.
  
  “Sisters”: – a poem by Darvide, slipped under the door.
  
  I don’t have to be alone in my house
  My sister is born
  But I am alone in my room
  Caring for my sister makes me happy
  I feel happy to spend time
  When my sister is far away
  I am alone again.
  
  We are going to take a turn from the usual doctrine to introduce a couple of young faces to the TBC office space. We’ve taken a huge risk by trusting the HR department with these recruits – but so far we are thanking our lucky stars. With any company that has a lot of equity, risk can be massive and you need to weigh up the pros and cons. Based on a short cover letter from each recruit (attached at end of doc), TBC has taking a massive nosedive by getting these 2 young men on 3 month variable prohibitive contracts. Here is a small corporate lesson from the girls while we are on this contentious topic - it’s important to leave contracts open ended and easily terminated. We can get out of this easily so if you are starting to worry – don’t. As most things at TBC we operate on a read-between-the-lines premise and our employment contracts are no different. You can find meaning where you like. In fact – you’ll find a physical absence of sick leave and bereavement leave clause – but if you present a good case we will give it a lot of hard consideration.
  
  Now back to the matter at hand – the young son and the young man come with a collective experience of 17 years in not-necessarily significant employment roles. Both are self-confessed workaholics and alcoholics with a terrible desire for power. We will keep this at bay.
  
  The young son came in day 1 with a tray of donuts and a 3 litre bottle of grappa. His intentions while obviously good, fell short the morning after his initiation party.  If his eyes could speak, it was clear that this young son wanted nothing but good things for the team. The remains of the grappa have been inventoried and will be used in a punch at the annual 2016 TBC Christmas event. At the party, things sky rocketed when the young man took a Kazakstan approach to alcohol consumption and socializing. The man knew how to tug on the heartstrings of the team – he initiated a big toast to the Listovich dynasty. He may or may not have consummated with Geraldine herself in the inventory room after his appreciation speech about the old family line.  He proceeded to play softly ‘Wagon Wheel’ on the guitar and the young son did a slow jig around the HR department. The whole experience was hypnotic to say the least – completely out of this world. Everyone was feeling tender and captivated, with his or her most inner emotions exposed physically. The girls, being in charge of the operation had to take the guitar of the young man and inventory it for the next Hooley.
  
  So you may be wondering – what happened to the young son which caused so much distress to the entire team the next day? Well, let us tell you that we have absolutely no idea. He has been absent for the last 40 hours, we think he has skipped town with Genevieve.
  PLEASE READ AND SEND ANY THOUGHTS COMMENTS OR OPINIONS TO TBC@GMAIL.COM ATTN. HR
  
  Hello TBC,
  
  I am a young son from Marizone and I saw your website advertised down at the country club. I understand you are looking for an intern. In no possible world would I ever sink to the level of an intern but I can make you an offer of my full services on a very sustainable and affordable salary.
  
  I am a son of simple men, I have recently fully developed physically and mentally I have been full for a while. I am currently on a spiritual quest to extract content from my own vulnerable friends. My friend, the young man, also comes along with me for the ride – free of charge but of course reflective in my starting rate.
  
  The first topic I’d like to breach with you is renumeration and bonuses. I would like my bonus to be based on one principle – a factual one. It will be based on the literal amount of hours the young man spends in the office. I will attach a small tracker to his PC which will monitor his productivity both at home and in the office.
  
  Now to tell you what I can offer in practicality – concepts aside.I’ve attached a poem from the young man – he gave it to me for my 40th. Let me tell you more before I type it out.
  
  The young man does not communicate in conversational language. He speaks in poems. I’ve had to contract a Bangladeshi company to develop a translation app for the young mans unique way of communication. The algorithm used in this app is something that is patented and belongs to me only so is not company property and don’t ask for it. 
  First things first – a huge thank you to the World Wide Web for providing us with a home for the last 2 days.  
  
  The Devils Dyke is an alpine area of the world, nesting softly in the hills between Hove and Brighton. TBC instantly took to the warm days and cool nights of the Devil’s Dyke, setting up a shared office space on top of a small white car. The countryside was so good that Constable decided to paint it – the girls understood exactly why. After feeling enamoured by the alpine air and the hills, further inquiry was needed as every emotion needs an explanation. We discovered that Devils Dyke had found a natural balance of protection, freedom, responsibility and occupation. The place was no ones and belonged to itself.
  
  The whole community of Devil’s Dyke, Brighton and Hove welcomed us in with loving arms, showing us pure kindness and respect. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the team at Brighton Tyres International for their hospitality. After an off-road stint our home/car had some minor damage but the boys patched it up with a laugh and a cable tie.
  
  The nights were not without fun, success and also severe paranoia.  The paranoia was eased when we came to the realization that 11:00pm is Devil’s Hour – where guests are no longer acknowledged when they enter our safe zone.
  
  A lack of a water source that is above head height was one of the worst things about Devils Dyke. But as always – a problem always has a solution. The girls found salvation in a sponge bath and a pub bathroom for freshening up.
  
  One of the main attractions of Devils Dyke is  a trip out with the High Flyer Aero-dynamics Club. This is a tourist experience lead by the Gravity Defying Serious Woman. We are living testament that her knowledge of wind channels is second to none and that she has eradicated fear from her life.
  
  A direct quote from this individual so you can understand life a bit more - “Find your social circle in the sky”
  
  Another break-through moment for the girls was finding a new appreciatoon of salami – utilizing this cured meat in a broth and in it’s organic state. 
  The team has just merged onto the Orbital Highway, the name could not be more fitting as our current mood does not belong in this universe.
  
  Let us recap over the London Seven, exploring as always through some big concepts.
  
  One of the most shocking things about London was a very small cellphone witnessed being used by a pre-elderly male commuter. At first glance the device seemed to be a small spying camera or vocal-recorder. One of the girls put on her seeing glasses and zeroed in on the device – to realize it had a full keypad, dual sim capabilities and appear (unconfirmed) to be connected to the world wide web. The existence of such a tiny thing on such a large intercity tube system sums up our trip so well.
  
  As with every good location, a guardian is the first thing a girl must see. Thank you Taki from Rotorua – without you near to us and genuinely caring about us we may not be here traversing the O.H.
  
  London can be divided into three locations, home, Grant’s house and of course Stephane’s. The Picadilly Line unites the three spaces physically but also was a metaphor for our heartstrings. Pulled along fast and heavily oiled.
  
  With an increased tolerance for exhaustion and a fully-loaded Oyster card, no opportunities were missed in London.  The OC serves as a facilitator to London – and the balance represents the safeness of the holder. It’s common and expected to inquire with new people as to the balance of their OC – online and in real life. This is usually necessary, as you need to know how far people are able to travel in one block of time as London often calls for big transits.
  
  A new home is currently in development, a Toyota Auris. Fully stocked with fresh bedding courtesy of the beautiful Flaherty family, the tent will be pitched tonight (on the roof) and the girls will have warm bodies and heavy hearts. The girls will eat cheap ravioli, watch gossip girl and be 100% smug thinking of all they have achieved and whats to come – both on the blog and in real life.  There is nothing more centering than ravioli. We will warn you now a full glossary of characters will be coming soon. No one is safe.
  
  Sending as always, a large amount of love into the most Southern country of the world and wherever else our hearts have been left.
  
  Good luck everyone and keep safe on the roads. 
  You would rightfully find it hard to be believe that the entire TBC team that brought you TBC Chapter 1 are currently isolated in a foreign land. There is many cases where transit goes horribly wrong, however this is not one of them. But we would be lying to say the our current predicament was premeditated.
  
  The TBC duo hit New Delhi hard with passion and excitement for a spicy food court curry, however this did not persist as the girls were faced with sexism and a looming 15 hour stop over - this being 13 hours longer than what was expected.
  
  Calling back an integral concept the team realised with pleasure that there is not much else to do in this situation then make it work. 1 hour later, red wine, chocolate and an aqua pod had been introduced to the scene. Now the long wait had been redefined with a  9 hour stint of  ‘dark time’ in the Holiday Inn. On that note we would like to recount the last 2 weeks, we will use dark time as our central focus.
  
  July 21st- Touch down. TBC 1 and 2 are united for the first time in 3 full moons and our first guardian is introduced, Ming. Defying traffic regulations (if they exist) and the natural progression of time he took us under his wing and relocated our exhausted bodies to his lavish mobile. Along the way a small women joined us, Pom, she offered more love and translation then we had bargained for. A salad covered in flies was consumed and Ming ate an entire chicken.
  
  Reaching Koh Chang we realised that this was indeed our home, both spiritually and actually (for 2 weeks). We settled into our ocean view bungalow and prepared ourselves physically for a night out.  With a new associate in tow (big ups Rino) the 3 of us were ready to conquer this small Thai town, and that we did. Despite an evident decline in tourism during the rainy season one man made his way into our hearts and will no doubt stay there forever.  Himmel Bar became our hunting ground for food and friends, the playlist was second to none and was consistent to a point where it risked becoming predictable. Our third eyes were opened and we are still questioning if they have yet been closed.
  
  Self diagnosis was something we became all too familiar with, and fortunately for the Buddy Pharmacy could in most cases be sorted with a friendly prescription within minutes. However our most persistent diagnosis (nocturnalism) was accentuated and prompted by blackout curtains= dark time. 
  
  Somehow the team plus our new associate gained the strength one day to venture out of our cocoon and take a snorkeling excursion. This would have been excellent had there been more fish and 75% less tourists.  Regardless, we became enamoured with a small brooding child who reminded us of a reincarnated Vincent Van Gogh. We concluded that his presence in Thailand was the result of his families unrealistic goal to try shed some of the baggage he inherited from the old soul himself. Unfortunately it was clear to even a stranger that this baggage had passed customs and was well and truly fully enjoying the holiday with them.
  
  As we said goodbye to Koh Chang, we unanimously muttered “it’s been real”. And that it had. We took Bangkok by foot, bare and shoed.
  
  Let us use this opportunity to remind our readers to most importantly keep safe at all times but also to reestablish our central motto- make it work. We leave you now with this thought. 
  
  “It’s not the airport that you are in, but the opportunities that hide behind the stone walls and within the duty free shop”.Easter is a milestone in the year for many individuals. It’s common to think at Easter time “how did I make it this far”. It’s the time of year to reflect on how you survived many years of habitation and socialising with your peers and associates. If you’re happy, great - make sure to thank your associates for grounding you. If you’re unhappy you will need restructure your associates into a sphere that feels more safe. This will reflect into your inner psyche and by next Easter you have a 50% chance of being happy. Regardless of your feelings, this upcoming special long weekend is yours and yours only. Let us deconstruct tradition for you - just hop onto our shoulders and we will guide you into the light.
  
  It is plausible to assume that during sacred holidays you must follow the rules even more strictly than on the non-sacramental days of the year. However TBC down right disputes this notion.  Easter gifts you with 4 uninterrupted days of absolute chaos- the opportunities are only restrained by your own imagination. So don’t stay inside and eat an egg with a loved one, don’t bake a batch of hot cross buns- put away the flour and eggs and shake your hands of responsibility. Open your front door-  what’s that smell you ask? That my old friend is the smell of freedom. Breath it in.
  
  Easter was first addressed in the inaugural Easterial Manifesto written by an anonymous prophet in the deep South of USA in the early 1600’s. This document has had a long and treacherous life - let me try and put this simply. It was hurled off a container ship in the 1800’s in protest of the reconstitution of marine law. It washed up on a beach near a small pacific island where it was rediscovered by James Cook. It’s ideas spread and the magic of Easter was well and truly thriving in the pacific islands well into the 1800’s. With the migration of peoples and cross cultural exploration, the Easterial Manifesto was duplicated and disseminated through every country in the world. It became a document of historical and cultural significance and is still celebrated to this day by the citizens of planet earth.
  
  This disruptive journey has meant that the Easterial Manifesto was only partially legible when it finally reached the Pacific. With roughly 400 of the 1600 pages decipherable. The remaining 1200 pages are worth so little that they might as well be at the bottom of a bin. What we do know is that Easter is polarising. It separates two parties- those who dwell in mess and those who thrive for legislation. A basic way to think about this is ‘those who are dedicated to the common good’ and those who are driven to drink by goodness.
  
  We have no clue how to wrap this post up - so we’ll end with the classic TBC mantras we’re constantly drumming into your minds. Make it work, take it on the chin and keep safe this holiday season.
