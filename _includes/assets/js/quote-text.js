    "content": "A skinny moon like all skinny things calls to the modern mind and with it and under its light you will birth your herbal self. Your solar plexus is lost in a river of tribulations and confusions, so try and kept it real, ladies, as you open your peepers to this toasty TBC exclusive. Deep under your hairs, under the skin and body lies a dark and heavy moist massive microclimate where your herbals flourish and procreate in the agar (gut). When one human becomes aware of their herbals they recoil and become more likely to withdraw and withstand time. They will become drawn to the skinny moon and be christened under its powerful beams. A moment of isolation under this moon calls for a total overhaul of the soul, and body. Let us make it very clear that no way do we recommend driving machinery while you’re wearing your herbals on your sleeve. Take this time to connect with your family members and keep this information handy as you do not want to be decomposing. Remember to feed and water your herbals, each one the same. They like to be equal with their brothers and offspring (micro-herbals) just like any other organism. All organisms on earth have a certain level of capacity for self-development that cannot be breached. This fact is protected by marine law and was created as part of a science project carried out by the Insitute of Aluminium Poisons Research Foundation in 1809. Just as your bloody travels within your central-fugal tubes, your herbals have their own communicative network which runs adjacent to the capillaries. As your herbals oxygenate, they become aggravated and unpleasant. They become self-deprecating at such a rate that they can no longer transfuse. They are forced to a stop as they collide with your mass-pubis. there is no coming back from this point and you’re going to have to re-grow your herbals from scratch using a ‘scoby’ from another human beings herbal network (not cheap). Believe it or not folks, herbals are not the only force at play when you wake up in the morning.. your solar plexus is at its peak and is producing its own seeping mess- stop reading and wipe it up. Being aware of anatomy and the many sensations that happen in the world is essential to living a rewarding life. Breath them in and reward yourself for being a good host to the many agents within- scoby and solar plexus mess.  Its not a tidy job but it is a good job. We would like to use this shot in the dark at fame to applaud TBC for their latest victory as being the “World’s most desirable herbal host 2015”. We brought in the new year with a fresh batch of tasty herbals, imported from the Islands (pacific and Chatham).  They were ripe and there for the picking. We are still reeping the rewards. The herbal free folk are about as uncomfortable in social situations as a poorly attached catheter. Do with that analogy as you will. Thank you for reading this fantastic chapter of an even more stupendous, impressive and of course fantastic book. Rated as New York Times 2016 most intellectually provoking book of the year and runner up for “Progressive works of the late 2000s”. This book delves into the deeper questions about herbals and that everyone has about there body. Leaving nothing unanswered TBC has one mission. Please take all precautions seriously and factually.",
